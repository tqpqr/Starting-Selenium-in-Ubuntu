# Starting-Selenium-in-Ubuntu
Few things that need to be present in code to successfully start Selenium on Ubuntu server without graphical interface. 
This code uses pyvirtualdisplay (pyvirtualdisplay is a python wrapper for Xvfb, Xephyr and Xvnc): https://github.com/ponty/PyVirtualDisplay
(might be installed from repository with "pip install pyvirtualdisplay")

Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) need to be PRE-installed in system and virtual display need to be started before run selenium: 
...
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xvfb
Xvfb :1 -screen 99 1024x768x32    
# The server will listen for connections as server number 1, 
# and screen â„– 99 will be depth 32 bit 1024x768.
...

Good luck!
